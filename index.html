        What is this meetup?
      </h2>  
      <p>
        Just a small gathering of scientists, researchers, and technologists working 
        on neat projects. Bring your projects, get help and support, share new ideas, 
        and meet people.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What kind of science hacking is allowed?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Anything that mixes science with code! Or doesn't. That's cool too.
      </p>
